# AWS Well-Architected Review — Washing Machine Filter Reminder

> *This review applies the AWS Well-Architected Framework to a system designed to remind one person to clean one filter once a week. The framework was built for enterprise workloads. We are using it anyway.*

**Review date:** May 2026
**Reviewer:** Claude (AI-assisted self-assessment)
**Workload risk profile:** Low — single household, non-critical, no SLA, no revenue dependency

    title "Well-Architected Pillar Scores (out of 5)"
    x-axis ["Operational Excellence", "Security", "Reliability", "Performance Efficiency", "Cost Optimization", "Sustainability"]
    y-axis "Score" 0 --> 5
    bar [3, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3]
```

| Pillar | Score | HRI | MRI | Status |
|--------|:-----:|:---:|:---:|--------|
| Operational Excellence | 3/5 | 2 | 3 | ⚠️ Gaps in observability and automation |
| Security | 5/5 | 0 | 1 | ✅ Excellent — threat model fully maintained |
| Reliability | 3/5 | 2 | 1 | ⚠️ Silent failure risk on event-driven paths |
| Performance Efficiency | 4/5 | 0 | 2 | ✅ Well-optimised — minor tuning opportunities |
| Cost Optimization | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Effectively free |
| Sustainability | 3/5 | 0 | 1 | ⚠️ ARM/Graviton not used |
| **Overall** | **3.8/5** | **4** | **8** | |

**Key message:** The security and cost posture are exemplary for a workload of this type. The primary gaps are operational — no alerting means a Lambda failure on Sunday morning would go undetected until someone notices they haven't received an email. Addressing the two High Risk Issues would materially improve reliability confidence.

## Workload Context

Before applying best practices, it is worth acknowledging what this workload is and is not:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Criticality | Low — a missed reminder means a dirty filter, not a business outage |
| Users | 1 (Sue) |
| Revenue dependency | None |
| Data sensitivity | Low-medium — PII (email/phone) protected in Secrets Manager |
| Recovery time objective | Hours to days (acceptable) |
| Recovery point objective | 1 week (one missed cycle is tolerable) |

Some Well-Architected best practices (multi-region, cross-AZ replication, chaos engineering) are acknowledged but explicitly accepted as out of scope for this risk profile.

---

## Pillar 1 — Operational Excellence

*Run and monitor systems to deliver business value, and continually improve supporting processes and procedures.*

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|:----:|----------------|
| OE-1 | **No CloudWatch alarms** — Lambda errors, throttles, and duration spikes produce no alerts | 🔴 High | Add CloudWatch metric alarms for `Errors` and `Throttles` on all three Lambda functions. Route to an SNS email topic. ~5 minutes to configure. |
| OE-2 | **No dead letter queue (DLQ)** — EventBridge invokes Lambdas asynchronously. After 2 retries, failed events are silently discarded | 🔴 High | Add an SQS DLQ to each Lambda's event source mapping. Configure a CloudWatch alarm on `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` > 0. |
| OE-3 | **Unstructured logging** — Lambda handlers use `print()` producing plain text. Log querying in CloudWatch Insights is difficult | 🟡 Medium | Replace `print()` with Python's `logging` module using a JSON formatter. Enables structured queries like `filter @message.status = "CONFIRMED"`. |
| OE-4 | **No automated tests** — no unit or integration tests exist | 🟡 Medium | Add `pytest` unit tests for the core logic (`_escalating_sms`, `_sms_commentary`, `_week_pk`, etc.). Mock boto3 clients. Target >80% coverage. |
| OE-5 | **No CI/CD pipeline** — deployment is a manual `sam deploy` | 🟡 Medium | Add a GitHub Actions workflow: lint → test → `sam build` → `sam deploy` on push to `main`. |
| OE-6 | **No CloudWatch dashboard** — no single pane of glass for operational health | 🟢 Low | Create a dashboard with: Lambda invocation counts, error rates, DynamoDB read/write units, SES send metrics, CloudFront request counts. |

### Best Practices Met

- ✅ **OPS 1** — Workload is defined as code (SAM template)
- ✅ **OPS 5** — Test mode enables safe experimentation without production impact
- ✅ **OPS 6** — DynamoDB TTL automates data lifecycle management
- ✅ **OPS 8** — Documentation maintained alongside code in the same repository

---

## Pillar 2 — Security

*Protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.*

> This pillar is covered in depth in [`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md) (v1.3). Summary below.

### Findings

| # | Finding | Risk | Status |
|---|---------|:----:|--------|
| SEC-1 | Credentials in Lambda environment variables | 🔴 ~~High~~ | ✅ Resolved — moved to Secrets Manager |
| SEC-2 | No API Gateway rate limiting | 🟡 ~~Medium~~ | ✅ Resolved — 5 req/s, burst 10 |
| SEC-3 | PII (email/phone) in Lambda environment | 🟡 ~~Medium~~ | ✅ Resolved — moved to Secrets Manager |
| SEC-4 | Non-GB access to confirmation endpoint | 🟡 ~~Medium~~ | ✅ Resolved — CloudFront GB geo restriction |
| SEC-5 | DynamoDB CloudTrail data events not enabled | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ Open — no data-plane audit log |
| SEC-6 | `ses:SendEmail` IAM action scoped to `Resource: '*'` | 🟢 Low | Could be narrowed to verified identity ARNs |

### Best Practices Met

- ✅ **SEC 1** — Implement a strong identity foundation (IAM least-privilege, no wildcard actions on sensitive resources)
- ✅ **SEC 2** — Enable traceability (CloudWatch logs, `confirmed_at` timestamp)
- ✅ **SEC 3** — Apply security at all layers (CloudFront → API GW throttle → token validation → IAM)
- ✅ **SEC 4** — Protect data in transit (HTTPS enforced via CloudFront and API Gateway)
- ✅ **SEC 5** — Protect data at rest (DynamoDB default encryption, secrets in Secrets Manager)
- ✅ **SEC 7** — Prepare for security events (threat model maintained, findings tracked)

---

## Pillar 3 — Reliability

*Ensure a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.*

### Findings

    participant EB as EventBridge
    participant L  as Lambda
    participant DLQ as DLQ (missing)
    participant CW as CloudWatch (no alarm)

    EB->>L: Invoke (async)
    L->>L: Error occurs
    Note over L: Retry 1 of 2
    L->>L: Error again
    Note over L: Retry 2 of 2
    L->>L: Error again
    L--xDLQ: Event discarded silently
    Note over DLQ,CW: Nobody knows.\nSue never gets her email.\nThe filter remains unclean.
```

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|:----:|----------------|
| REL-1 | **No dead letter queue** — async Lambda failures are silently discarded after 2 retries | 🔴 High | Add SQS DLQ to `SendWeeklyEmailFunction` and `SendDailySMSFunction`. Alert on non-empty queue. |
| REL-2 | **No failure alerting** — Lambda errors produce no notification | 🔴 High | CloudWatch alarm on `AWS/Lambda Errors` metric for all functions, threshold 1, period 300s. |
| REL-3 | **No post-deploy verification** — no automated check that Sunday's email was actually sent | 🟡 Medium | Add a Monday morning EventBridge rule that checks DynamoDB for a `WEEK#<last-sunday>` record with `email_sent_at` populated. Alert if missing. |
| REL-4 | **Single region** — `eu-west-2` only | 🟢 Low | Accepted for this risk profile. Recovery is a `sam deploy` to another region. |

### Best Practices Met

- ✅ **REL 1** — Automatic recovery from failure (Lambda retries, idempotent confirmation endpoint)
- ✅ **REL 2** — Test recovery procedures (test mode validates the full path without production impact)
- ✅ **REL 8** — Use highly available managed services (DynamoDB, SES, Lambda — all multi-AZ by default)
- ✅ **REL 9** — Automate failure handling (DynamoDB TTL, idempotent operations prevent data corruption)
- ✅ **REL 10** — Use fault isolation (single-purpose Lambda functions; a failure in `ConfirmTask` doesn't affect `SendWeeklyEmail`)

---

## Pillar 4 — Performance Efficiency

*Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.*

### Findings

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|:----:|----------------|
| PERF-1 | **Lambda on x86 architecture** — all three functions use x86 (default). ARM (Graviton2) delivers ~20% better price-performance | 🟡 Medium | Add `Architectures: [arm64]` to Globals in `template.yaml`. Python 3.12 fully supports ARM Lambda. No code changes required. |
| PERF-2 | **Lambda memory not tuned** — default 128MB used. Actual memory use may allow reduction (lower cost) or require increase (faster execution) | 🟡 Medium | Run [AWS Lambda Power Tuning](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning) step function against each handler to find the optimal memory/cost balance. |
| PERF-3 | **Twilio SDK loaded unconditionally** — `from twilio.rest import Client` is inside a conditional block but the `twilio` package is always present in the deployment package, adding cold start overhead when unused | 🟢 Low | Separate optional dependencies into a Lambda Layer, or use conditional packaging in `requirements.txt`. |
| PERF-4 | **Global Lambda timeout of 30s** — `ConfirmTask` completes in ~500ms; a 30s timeout is unnecessarily permissive | 🟢 Low | Set per-function timeouts: `SendWeeklyEmail` 30s (calls SES + external APIs), `SendDailySMS` 15s, `ConfirmTask` 10s. |

### Best Practices Met

- ✅ **PERF 1** — Secrets Manager response cached at module level — no per-invocation API call
- ✅ **PERF 2** — DynamoDB single-item GetItem by partition key — O(1) regardless of table size
- ✅ **PERF 3** — CloudFront PriceClass_100 — GB users served from nearest European edge nodes
- ✅ **PERF 4** — PAY_PER_REQUEST on DynamoDB — no over-provisioning at any traffic level
- ✅ **PERF 5** — Serverless architecture — no idle compute resources

---

## Pillar 5 — Cost Optimization

*Avoid unnecessary costs.*

### Current Cost Profile

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor': '#1e3a5f', 'primaryTextColor': '#c9d1d9', 'primaryBorderColor': '#4a7ab5', 'lineColor': '#58a6ff'}}}%%

pie title Monthly cost breakdown (~$0.40 total)
    "Secrets Manager (1 secret)" : 85
    "Everything else (free tier)" : 15
```

| Service | Monthly usage | Monthly cost |
|---------|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Lambda | ~40 invocations, ~20s total compute | Free tier |
| DynamoDB | ~4 reads, ~4 writes, ~1KB stored | Free tier |
| SES | ~8 emails | Free tier |
| CloudFront | ~5 requests | Free tier |
| API Gateway | ~5 requests | Free tier |
| EventBridge | 5 rules | Free |
| Secrets Manager | 1 secret + ~40 GetSecretValue calls | **~$0.40** |
| **Total** | | **~$0.40/month** |

### Findings

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|:----:|----------------|
| COST-1 | **Secrets Manager at $0.40/month** — the single meaningful cost in this workload | 🟢 Low | SSM Parameter Store SecureString is free for standard parameters and would eliminate this cost. Trade-off: less auditable, no automatic rotation. At $0.40/month the trade-off does not justify migration. |

### Best Practices Met

- ✅ **COST 1** — Practice Cloud Financial Management — cost reviewed and documented
- ✅ **COST 2** — Expenditure and usage awareness — costs are minimal and entirely within free tier except Secrets Manager
- ✅ **COST 3** — Cost-effective resources — serverless; no provisioned capacity; PAY_PER_REQUEST
- ✅ **COST 4** — Manage demand and supply — DynamoDB auto-scales; Lambda scales to zero
- ✅ **COST 5** — Optimise over time — TTL prevents unbounded storage accumulation

---

## Pillar 6 — Sustainability

*Minimise the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.*

### Findings

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|:----:|----------------|
| SUS-1 | **Lambda on x86 architecture** — ARM (Graviton2) processors are ~60% more energy-efficient per unit of compute than equivalent x86 | 🟡 Medium | Switch to `arm64` in `template.yaml` (same change as PERF-1). This is the single most impactful sustainability improvement available. |
| SUS-2 | **No resource tagging** — AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool and cost allocation reports require consistent tagging | 🟢 Low | Add stack-level tags: `Project`, `Environment`, `Owner`. In SAM, use the `Tags` section under `Globals`. |

### Current Sustainability Strengths

- ✅ **SUS 1** — Serverless architecture — compute is near-zero between invocations (~99.9% idle time)
- ✅ **SUS 2** — CloudFront PriceClass_100 — restricts traffic to US/EU edge locations (lower transport emissions than global distribution)
- ✅ **SUS 3** — DynamoDB TTL — data is automatically expired, preventing unbounded storage energy consumption
- ✅ **SUS 4** — Right-sized traffic volume — the system processes the minimum viable number of requests to achieve its purpose
